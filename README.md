## Business Problem

In recent years, both City Hotel and Resort Hotel have been grappling with high cancellation rates. This has led to several challenges, including decreased revenue and suboptimal utilization of hotel rooms. Addressing and reducing cancellation rates is a critical goal for both hotels to enhance revenue generation and operational efficiency. This project aims to analyze hotel booking cancellations and identify key factors that contribute to the issue.

## Research Questions

1. **Variables Affecting Cancellations**: The primary focus is to identify the variables that significantly influence hotel reservation cancellations.

2. **Reducing Cancellations**: The project aims to provide insights into strategies to mitigate hotel reservation cancellations and improve overall booking reliability.

3. **Pricing and Promotional Decisions**: The analysis aims to assist hotels in making informed decisions regarding pricing and promotional activities, considering the factors affecting cancellations.

## Hypotheses

1. **Price Effect**: It is hypothesized that higher prices lead to increased reservation cancellations, as customers may seek more affordable options.

2. **Waitlist Impact**: The hypothesis is that when the waiting list for hotel rooms is longer, customers are more likely to cancel their reservations due to uncertainty.

3. **Offline Travel Agents**: The hypothesis suggests that a significant portion of reservations are made through offline travel agents, which might contribute to cancellation rates.

## Data Analysis Approach

The project involves analyzing a dataset containing hotel booking information to explore the relationships between various variables and booking cancellations. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, statistical analyses, and visualization tools will be utilized to gain insights into the factors driving cancellations and propose potential solutions.
